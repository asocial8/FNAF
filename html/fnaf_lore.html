        <ol>
            <li>Pre-1980s: 
                <ul>
                    <li>William Afton, a gifted engineer with a sinister curiosity, begins experimenting with animatronics and artificial intelligence. He also studies the human soul and theorizes how it could be preserved after death.</li>
                    <li>Afton partners with Henry Emily to open Fredbear’s Family Diner, a modest local restaurant featuring two Springlock animatronics: Fredbear and Spring Bonnie. These suits can be worn by employees or function autonomously.</li>
                    <li>While the diner thrives, Afton secretly uses the Spring Bonnie suit to lure and murder children. Their spirits begin to cling to the animatronics, unknowingly creating the first haunted robots.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Early to Mid-1980s:
                <ul>
                    <li>The Bite of ’83 occurs: Afton’s younger son is tormented by his older brother and shoved too close to Fredbear’s jaws during a birthday party. The animatronic clamps down, fatally injuring him. The event causes public backlash and Fredbear’s closes.</li>
                    <li>Fazbear Entertainment is formed. A new location, Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza, opens with four new animatronics: Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy, all equipped with facial recognition and mobility programming.</li>
                    <li>William continues his killing spree, leading to the disappearance of five children. The "Missing Children Incident" sparks investigations, but no bodies are found. The children's souls possess the main animatronics.</li>
                    <li>The Puppet (Charlotte Emily, Henry’s daughter) is murdered outside the diner and left to die alone. Her spirit inhabits the Puppet animatronic, and she later helps other murdered children's souls find vessels in the suits.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Late 1980s:
                <ul>
                    <li>A sister location, Circus Baby’s Pizza World, is built in secret by Afton. It features advanced animatronics like Circus Baby, Ballora, Funtime Freddy, and Funtime Foxy, all designed with hidden mechanisms for kidnapping children.</li>
                    <li>Afton's daughter, Elizabeth, is killed by Circus Baby when she gets too close during a private demonstration. Her spirit possesses Circus Baby.</li>
                    <li>The facility is shut down before its public opening due to “gas leaks,” but it continues operations underground as a facility for testing and hiding animatronics.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>1993:
                <ul>
                    <li>The events of Five Nights at Freddy’s (FNAF 1) take place. Mike Schmidt works the night shift at Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza, surviving five nights while being hunted by the haunted animatronics.</li>
                    <li>The spirits of the missing children (Gabriel, Jeremy, Susie, Fritz, and possibly Cassidy) are revealed to be possessing Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy. They confuse Mike for Afton and try to take revenge.</li>
                    <li>The restaurant closes after increasing complaints, foul smells, and sightings of “moving robots.”</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Post-1993:
                <ul>
                    <li>William Afton is eventually killed after entering one of the old Springlock suits while hiding from spirits. The Springlocks fail and crush him, turning him into Springtrap. His body remains hidden inside the walls of the now-abandoned pizzeria.</li>
                    <li>Fazbear Frights is later established on the ruins of the old location. Springtrap is discovered and becomes part of the attraction in FNAF 3.</li>
                    <li>After a fire, Springtrap escapes, and Afton’s soul persists, creating multiple digital and physical echoes in FNAF: Help Wanted and Security Breach.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
